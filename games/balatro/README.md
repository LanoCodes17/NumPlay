## Highlights

* **The whole core game:** Small, Big and Boss Blinds, the shop, booster packs, skip tags and Endless mode after Ante 8.
* **All 150 Jokers**, including the Legendary ones from The Soul, plus every Tarot, Planet and Spectral card, all 32 Vouchers and 24 Tags.
* **All 28 Boss Blinds**, with their own colours and effects, and the five final bosses.
* **Scoring like the original:** cards score left to right, then held cards, then Jokers, with retriggers, editions and seals, and every chip and mult popping up.
* **The look of the game:** the original card and Joker art, the moving paint background, the same panels, colours and font, the fire behind a hand that beats the Blind, and the foil, holographic, polychrome and negative sheens.
* **Saves everything:** press Home at any moment and pick your run back up exactly where you left it.
* Red Deck, White Stake.
